Prognostic immune gene sets enriched in the ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype were associated with interferon signaling and ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathways. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified three sub-networks and nine key hub genes. This study integrates gene expression data from newly diagnosed AML patients, revealing the heterogeneity of pyroptosis patterns within the population.

We found that BCL2L1, the gene encoding BCL-xL, is expressed at higher levels in post-MPN AML patients compared to those with de novo AML. Single-cell multi-omics analysis revealed that leukemia cells harboring both MPN-driver and TP53 mutations exhibited higher BCL2L1 expression, elevated scores for leukemia stem cell, megakaryocyte development, and erythroid progenitor than wild-type cells. BH3 profiling confirmed a strong dependence on BCL-xL in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 alone, or in combination with standard AML/MPN therapies, effectively degraded BCL-xL, reduced the apoptotic threshold, and induced apoptosis in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 effectively eliminated viable cells in JAK2-mutant AML cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (iPSC-HPCs), primary samples, and reduced tumor burden in cell line-derived xenograft model in vivo by degrading BCL-xL. DT2216, either as a single agent or in combination with azacytidine, effectively inhibited the clonogenic potential of CD34+ leukemia cells from post-MPN AML patients.

BCL-xL has been found to be overexpressed in leucocytes from MPN patients, making it a potential therapeutic target. We investigated the role of BCL-xL in post-MPN AML and tested the efficacy of DT2216, a platelet- sparing BCL-xL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), in preclinical models of post-MPN AML. We found that BCL2L1, the gene encoding BCL-xL, is expressed at higher levels in post-MPN AML patients compared to those with de novo AML. Single-cell multi-omics analysis revealed that leukemia cells harboring both MPN-driver and TP53 mutations exhibited higher BCL2L1 expression, elevated scores for leukemia stem cell, megakaryocyte development, and erythroid progenitor than wild-type cells. BH3 profiling confirmed a strong dependence on BCL-xL in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 alone, or in combination with standard AML/MPN therapies, effectively degraded BCL-xL, reduced the apoptotic threshold, and induced apoptosis in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 effectively eliminated viable cells in JAK2-mutant AML cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (iPSC-HPCs), primary samples, and reduced tumor burden in cell line-derived xenograft model in vivo by degrading BCL-xL. DT2216, either as a single agent or in combination with azacytidine, effectively inhibited the clonogenic potential of CD34+ leukemia cells from post-MPN AML patients. In summary, our data indicate that the survival of post-MPN AML is BCL-xL dependent, and DT2216 may offer therapeutic advantage in this high-risk leukemia subset with limited treatment options.","['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)', 'Post-MPN AML']","['BCL-xL', 'BCL2L1', 'JAK2', 'TP53']","['Leukemia stem cell', 'Megakaryocyte development', 'Erythroid progenitor', 'Apoptosis']","['Single-cell multi-omics analysis', 'BH3 profiling', 'Cell line-derived xenograft model', 'Clonogenic potential assay']","The survival of post-MPN AML is BCL-xL dependent, and DT2216, a BCL-xL degrader, may offer therapeutic advantage in this high-risk leukemia subset with limited treatment options."
