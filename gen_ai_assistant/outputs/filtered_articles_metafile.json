WGCNA revealed that the brown module was most strongly associated with AML. Single-cell analysis showed that NKT cell infiltration was significantly reduced in AML patients, consistent with ssGSEA results. Forty intersecting genes were identified between NKT cell marker genes and brown module genes. Cox Lasso regression identified 10 prognostic genes (FGFBP2, GZMB, GZMH, IKZF3, IL2RB, KLRB1, KLRC2, RHOF, RUNX3, and STAT4). A risk score model based on these genes stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant differences in survival prognosis between the two groups.

Here, we aim to characterize high-risk neuroblastoma subpopulations and identify effective repurposed drugs for targeted treatment. We performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of neuroblastoma samples, integrating bulk RNA-seq data deconvolution with clinical outcomes to define distinct malignant cell states. Using a systematic drug repurposing pipeline, we identified and validated potential therapeutic agents targeting specific high-risk neuroblastoma subpopulations. Single-cell analysis revealed 17 transcriptionally distinct neuroblastoma subpopulations. Survival analysis identified a highly aggressive subpopulation characterized by elevated UBE2C\/PTTG1 expression and poor patient outcomes, distinct from a less aggressive subpopulation with favorable prognosis. Drug repurposing screening identified Adavosertib as particularly effective against the aggressive subpopulation, validated using SK-N-DZ cells as a representative model. Mechanistically, Adavosertib suppressed cell proliferation through AKT\/mTOR pathway disruption, induced G2\/M phase cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis. Further analysis revealed UBE2C and PTTG1 as key molecular drivers of drug resistance, where their overexpression enhanced proliferation, Adavosertib resistance, and cell migration.

Experimental methods included RT-qPCR, siRNA transfection, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.  TKT was significantly upregulated in multiple cancers and correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly in HCC. Elevated TKT expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC and was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that higher TKT expression was associated with reduced sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic agents, including sorafenib (p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the TKT promoter and low TKT expression were linked to improved OS in HCC (log-rank test p = 0.005).

Our bioinformatics and statistical analyses revealed an increased proportion of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in NCRT and identified the Ep_c1 subtype associated with a better prognosis. Further results indicated a complex communication network between Ep_c1 and myCAFs. The top 30 marker genes of myCAFs were used to construct a prognostic signature with a significant response to immunotherapy. Finally, experiments identified Complement C1s subcomponent (C1S), Decorin (DCN), and Neuroblastoma suppression of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1) as potential ESCC risk-related genes.  Our findings highlight the dynamic alterations in the post-NCRT ESCC microenvironment and provide a foundation for the development of personalized treatment and immunotherapeutic approaches. Future studies are warranted to further validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.","llm_class":"relevant"},{"pubmed_id":40196673,"title":"Redirecting cytotoxic lymphocytes to breast cancer tumors via metabolite-sensing receptors.","journal":"bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology (bioRxiv)","keywords":" ","abstract":" Insufficient infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes to solid tumors limits the efficacy of immunotherapies and cell therapies.

While these miRNAs are known to influence cardiomyocyte differentiation, the specific role of MIR503HG in heart development remains unexplored. We seek to determine how MIR503HG deletion impacts ventricular chamber development and to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.  To study the role of the lncRNA in vivo, we generated a functional MIR503HG knockout mouse model (MIR503HG-\/-) using a synthetic polyadenylation signal to terminate MIR503HG transcription without affecting miR-424\/503 expression. We performed morphological analyses on embryonic and adult hearts using microCT along with cardiac functional analysis via transthoracic echocardiography. We further apply single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA- seq) on adult hearts to identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes. Functional deletion of MIR503HG alone was associated with reduced compact myocardium thickness and increased trabecular myocardium in the left ventricle (LV) at embryonic day 17.5 compared to wild- type mice, indicating a LV non-compaction (LVNC) phenotype. Moreover, adult MIR503HG-\/- mutant hearts showed increased trabecular complexity, impaired LV relaxation, and mitral valve regurgitation. SnRNA-seq further revealed altered expression of several genes associated with cardiomyocyte function and LVNC, including Actc1, Mib1, Mybpc3, and Myh7. Lastly, Notch1 activity was also significantly increased in mutant hearts which has been previously associated with LVNC. MIR503HG plays a role in ventricular chamber development, and its deletion leads to an LVNC phenotype independent of the miRNA cluster within its locus, highlighting its importance in cardiac development and disease. We further suggest that abnormal Notch1 activity may underpin the LVNC phenotype presented.","llm_class":"relevant"},{"pubmed_id":40165206,"title":"CRISPR screens with trastuzumab emtansine in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines reveal new insights into drug resistance.","journal":"Breast cancer research : BCR (Breast Cancer Res)","keywords":"Antibody-drug conjugates, CRISPR\/Cas9, Drug resistance, Functional genomics, HER2-positive breast cancer, T-DM1, TSC1, TSC2","abstract":" Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that is an effective therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its efficacy is limited by drug resistance.

We have conducted CRISPR\/Cas9 functional genomics modifier screens in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines to allow for unbiased discovery of T-DM1 sensitivity and resistance genes. Whole-genome knockout screens were carried out in MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cells treated with T-DM1 and its payload cytotoxin DM1.

We investigated the role of BCL-xL in post-MPN AML and tested the efficacy of DT2216, a platelet- sparing BCL-xL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), in preclinical models of post-MPN AML. We found that BCL2L1, the gene encoding BCL-xL, is expressed at higher levels in post-MPN AML patients compared to those with de novo AML. Single-cell multi-omics analysis revealed that leukemia cells harboring both MPN-driver and TP53 mutations exhibited higher BCL2L1 expression, elevated scores for leukemia stem cell, megakaryocyte development, and erythroid progenitor than wild-type cells. BH3 profiling confirmed a strong dependence on BCL-xL in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 alone, or in combination with standard AML\/MPN therapies, effectively degraded BCL-xL, reduced the apoptotic threshold, and induced apoptosis in post-MPN AML cells. DT2216 effectively eliminated viable cells in JAK2-mutant AML cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (iPSC-HPCs), primary samples, and reduced tumor burden in cell line-derived xenograft model in vivo by degrading BCL-xL. DT2216, either as a single agent or in combination with azacytidine, effectively inhibited the clonogenic potential of CD34+ leukemia cells from post-MPN AML patients. In summary, our data indicate that the survival of post-MPN AML is BCL-xL dependent, and DT2216 may offer therapeutic advantage in this high-risk leukemia subset with limited treatment options.","llm_class":"relevant"},{"pubmed_id":40184611,"title":"Enhanced the Trans-Cleavage Activity of CRISPR-Cas12a Using Metal-Organic Frameworks as Stimulants for Efficient Electrochemical Sensing of Circulating Tumor DNA.","journal":"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) (Adv Sci (Weinh))","keywords":"CRISPR\u2010based diagnostics, Cas12a\/crRNA, circulating tumor DNA, electrochemical biosensor, metal\u2010organic framework","abstract":" Continued development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-powered biosensing system on the electrochemical interface is vital for accurate and timely diagnosis in clinical practice.

Identifying molecular subtypes influenced by fatty acid metabolism were built by consensus clustering analysis. Independent prognostic genes were identified through random survival forest analysis, acquiring a novel risk signature. Risk signatures were validated internally and externally, and their independent prognostic value, immune landscape, and drug susceptibility were explored. The study systematically analyzed correlations between signature genes and seven major cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, cuproptosis, and disulfidptosis), encompassing over 1,200 genes to comprehensively explore the intricate relationships between these molecular signatures and diverse cell death mechanisms. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess pathway-level associations. Utilizing a single- cell dataset of neuroblastoma samples, cells were categorized and labeled based on UMAP analysis. Feature map visualization was employed to display the expression level and allocation of specific genes across various cell populations.

A machine learning approach was used to select 4 hub genes (CHD5, TP63, XKR4, and CTAG1A) for the establishment of a fatty acid metabolism prognostic risk model.

High risk score and low risk score groups displayed notable variations in the immune microenvironment, characterized by reduced immune cell infiltration in the high group leading to immune escape, and conversely, heightened responsiveness of the low group to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Single-cell dataset analysis highlighted significant expression of CHD5 in specific cell populations, suggesting its potential as a marker gene for neuroblastoma. Immunohistochemical staining revealed varying levels of CHD5 expression across different clinical stages of neuroblastoma, with decreased deposition observed as staging advances. Functionally, CHD5 expression was found to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma cells.  The developed fatty acid metabolism prognostic risk model underscores the significance of fatty acids in neuroblastoma prognosis and immune landscape, thereby facilitating the optimization of chemotherapy and immunotherapy strategies for this disease. The comprehensive analysis of cell death pathways revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms of signature genes, particularly highlighting TP63's central role in coordinating multiple cell death processes.
